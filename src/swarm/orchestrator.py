"""SwarmOrchestrator — Central coordinator for the THDSE-Swarm.

Manages agent lifecycle, collects candidates, computes algebraic consensus
via correlate_matrix + Bron-Kerbosch, handles UNSAT broadcasting (Localized
Quotient Isolation with Drift Reconciliation), and tracks swarm-level metrics.

Each round:
  1. Each agent runs local synthesis -> emits candidate PhaseMessages
  2. Orchestrator collects all candidates
  3. Compute consensus via correlate_matrix + Bron-Kerbosch (layered partial match)
  4. Decode consensus centroid -> Z3 -> Python AST
  5. If SAT: execute in sandbox -> evaluate fitness
     - If fitness > threshold: broadcast consensus to all agents
  6. If UNSAT: extract actual V_error -> broadcast ONLY to participating agents
     - Record wall in the global wall ledger for drift reconciliation
  7. Periodically reconcile drift: propagate aged walls to non-participating
     agents to prevent topological fragmentation (Tower of Babel effect)
  8. Track metrics
  9. Halt when: max_rounds reached OR stagnation_limit consecutive
     rounds with zero progress
